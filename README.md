# Vue RPG Web App

## Context

I was given the task to come up with a final project of my choosing for my Client Side development class.  I decided I would use Vue.js to create a single page web application that would store Dungeons and Dragons character data that could also be edited.  The idea was to provide players of Tabletop Role-playing Games (TTRPGs) a way to store their character information on a web application.

## Action

Created a Vue.js web application and gave it a local database of json objects for a set of random characters.  Methods for getting all characters, a specific one by id, and updating that character were created and stored within the data service of the app.  The layout of the page and its dynamic functionality were all out of the box defaults from Vue.  Vues were written for characters and character-details, and routes were configured to navigate the views.  

## Result and Refecltion

The app functioned as intended.  This was an earlier project in my academic career, and now I can see many ways in which the project could be improved.  Expanding the character objects to include more information would be helpful.  Creating more depth by allowing a user to group these characters by the groups they were in would also be helpful.  Giving the user a way to create characters on the app would greatly add to the intended purpose of the application.
